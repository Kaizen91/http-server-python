# http-server-python
exploration of python's socket library

This project is loosely based on this series of articles: https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbaws-part1/

I basically wanted to build a simple webserver that loops over the lyrics to DJ Otzi's hit song Hey Baby (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0GIaJuan9Y) 

I also wanted to explore concurrency in python so I've built that server in 3 ways: using processes, threads, and the asyncio library.
